Potential causes of methamphetamine-related keratitis can be divided into four categories resulting from (a) direct pharmacologic and physical effects of methamphetamine; (b) the toxic effects of diluting or "cutting" agents such as lidocaine and quinine; (c) effects related to the route of drug administration (intravenous, inhalation, smoking); and (d) manufacture-related effects of exposure to unintentional caustic contaminants in the final product.
