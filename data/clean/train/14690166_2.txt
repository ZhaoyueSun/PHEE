There is currently no consensus on the best treatment for unresectable hyaline-vascular variant or for multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD), because none of the reported regimens have consistently produced complete response or durable remission in the majority of patients In the present study, we report on the use of 2-CdA (2-chloro-deoxyadenosine) in three patients, two of them with MCD and one with unresectable hyaline-vascular type disease.
