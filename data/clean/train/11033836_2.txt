Placebo-controlled clinical trials of recombinant human interleukin-11 (rhIL-11, also known as oprelvekin [Neumega]) in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies have demonstrated significant efficacy in preventing postchemotherapy platelet nadirs of < or = 20,000/microL, and reducing the need for platelet transfusions while continuing chemotherapy without dose reductions.
