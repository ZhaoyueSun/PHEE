CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that: (i) amantadine probably exerts its anti-dyskinetic effect by acting on the "indirect" pathway; (ii) the pathophysiological mechanisms of subthalamotomy induced dyskinesias may differ from those involved in L-dopa induced dyskinesias; (iii) dyskinesias induced by STN surgery resolve spontaneously as compensatory mechanisms develop.
