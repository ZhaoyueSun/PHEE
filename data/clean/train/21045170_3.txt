A 47-year-old HIV-infected man with dilated cardiomyopathy and prolonged QT syndrome with an automatic implantable cardiovascular defibrillator device was prescribed subcutaneous enfuvirtide 90 mg twice daily as part of his antiretroviral regimen and oral extended-release niacin 500 mg/day for a high-density lipoprotein level of 8 mg/dL. After 1 week of concomitant therapy, the patient began experiencing extreme redness, edema, and swelling at the injection site that corresponded with the flushing sensation due to niacin.
